      "situation": "Developing AI systems that understand meaning beyond pattern matching",
      "what_happened": "Models trained only on text patterns lack true semantic understanding - they need grounding in structural relationships and information integration",

      "what_happened": "Models maintain fluency and low perplexity while losing semantic grounding - they sound right but are systematically wrong",
